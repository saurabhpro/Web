# First angular 4 app
This is the first angular app i have created using the tutorials from Udemy.

## created a card
to create a card first learn the trick of writing the 
div.form-group >tab
form.form-inline >tab

these notations will create divs forms automatically

## difference between ngIf and hidden
difference between ngIF and hidden is that even if you complete say 5 added task... which means hidden was called 5 times
tasks.length != 0

and hence the <h5/> message wpn't be displayed.

Helpful in say cases where you need to show archived messages on some other component.

ngIF will remove it from the dom.
