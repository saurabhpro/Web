<h1>{{title}}</h1>
<h2>My Heroes</h2>

<ul class="heroes">
    <li *ngFor="let hero of heroes" [class.selected]="hero === selectedHero" (click)="onSelect(hero)">
        <!--
        The (*) prefix to ngFor is a critical part of this syntax. 
        It indicates that the <li> element and its children constitute a master template.

        In the styles metadata that you added above, there is a custom CSS class named selected
        When the expression (hero === selectedHero) is true, Angular adds the selected CSS class. 
        When the expression is false, Angular removes the selected class.
    -->
        <span class="badge">{{hero.id}}</span> {{hero.name}}
    </li>
</ul>
<!--
<hero-detail [hero]="selectedHero"></hero-detail> -->

<div *ngIf="selectedHero">

    <!--When there is no selected hero, the ngIf directive removes the hero detail HTML from the DOM. 
        There are no hero detail elements or bindings to worry about.-->

    <h2>
        {{selectedHero.name | uppercase}} is my hero
    </h2>
    <button (click)="gotoDetail()">View Details</button>

    <!--
    <div><label>id: </label>{{selectedHero.id}}</div>
    <div>
        <label>name: </label>
        <input [(ngModel)]="selectedHero.name" placeholder="name">

            [(ngModel)] is the Angular syntax to bind the hero.name property to the textbox. 
            Data flows in both directions: from the property to the textbox, and from the textbox back to the property.

            Unfortunately, immediately after this change, the application breaks. If you looked in the browser console, 
            you'd see Angular complaining that "ngModel ... isn't a known property of input."

            Although NgModel is a valid Angular directive, it isn't available by default. It belongs to the optional FormsModule. 
            You must opt-in to using that module.
