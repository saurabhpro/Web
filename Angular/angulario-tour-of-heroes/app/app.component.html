<h1>{{title}}</h1>

<h2>{{hero.name}} details</h2>

<div><label>id: </label>{{hero.id}}</div>
<div>
        <label>name: </label>
        <input [(ngModel)]="hero.name" placeholder="name">
        
        <!-- [(ngModel)] is the Angular syntax to bind the hero.name property to the textbox. 
        Data flows in both directions: from the property to the textbox, and from the textbox back to the property.

        Unfortunately, immediately after this change, the application breaks. If you looked in the browser console, 
        you'd see Angular complaining that "ngModel ... isn't a known property of input."

        Although NgModel is a valid Angular directive, it isn't available by default. It belongs to the optional FormsModule. 
        You must opt-in to using that module.
