1. First is the first.html
    - a simple html to show the `substirng` capabilities with indexOf, lastIndexOf etc.

2. highlight.html
    - a simple `textarea` to input your text and an `input` box to provide your search pattern, if then you click on
      search, yellow highlighed matching text will be shown below
